# React/Redux Simple Blog App

I began work on this simple app to get a better idea of the structure of React and Redux. I specifically wanted to learn how to apply certain CRUD and RESTful Routing principles, I've grown comfortable with the MEN stack (Mongo, Express, and Node).

To note, this is my third project implementing a blog. I've created one using primarily PHP that is broken and I haven't gotten around to troubleshooting it yet.

<strong>Note: </strong> this blog is minimally style. I wanted to focus on how the routing worked!
